# TODO

## Before Assignment 3

- Fix my memory buttons. Memory is not working right now
- I guess I don't need the other two memory buttons - get rud of Y and Z, and rename X->M @done
- Use the tap / longpress for the memory button too @done

## Before Assignment 3 self-assigned extra credit

- Make autolayout look actually good??? lol
- Figure out better layouts for each screen size. You can't have a layout for portrait vs landscape? That's kinda fuckin weird...
- Implement a popover somewhere, like Papa does for his trig functions @done
- Do long presses for ClearAll @done

## Assignment 3

- Add graphic calc button
- Write the graphing view and play with it in the Playculator!! That will be cool & nice for showing off

## Assignment 3 self-assigned extra credit

- Make the graph button look like the graph is going to be
- Give myself a button to recenter and rezoom on my graph

# OutBreak! 

## Remaining tasks

- Switching from the game view to the settings view, then back to the game view, erases my brick boundaries?? 
- When all the bricks have been eliminated (or the game is otherwise over), put up an alert and then reset the bricks for the next game.
- Your game should be designed to support at least 4 different variables that control the way your game is played (e.g. number of bricks, ball bounciness, number of bouncing balls, a gravitational pull, special bricks that cause interesting behavior, etc.).
- Use a tab bar controller to add a second tab to your UI which contains a static table view with controls that let the user set these 4+ different variables to meaningful game-play values. Your game should start using them immediately (i.e. as soon as you click back on the main game play tab).
- This game-play settings MVC must use at least one of each of the following 3 iOS classes: UISwitch, UISegmentedControl and UIStepper (you may substitute UISlider for the UIStepper if thatâ€™s more appropriate to your setting).
    - Number of hits it takes to destroy a block
    - ? 
    - ? 
    - ? 
- Your game-play configurations must persist between application launchings.
- Your application should work on both iPhone and iPad. It is up to you to decide what differences exist between the two platforms (if any).
